# HW18-Social-Network-API

# Description

The Social Network API project is designed to create a backend infrastructure for a social network application. This API enables users to share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and manage a friend list, utilizing the power of NoSQL databases to handle large volumes of unstructured data efficiently. The project leverages Express.js for routing and MongoDB with Mongoose for database management.

* Motivation: The motivation behind this project is to gain hands-on experience with building APIs for social networks, focusing on handling large datasets and unstructured data.
* Why this project: This project was built to understand the backend dynamics of social networking platforms and to demonstrate the application of NoSQL databases in real-world scenarios.
* Problem it solves: It provides a scalable solution for managing user-generated content and interactions in a social network, addressing common issues such as data storage, retrieval, and relationship management.
* What I learned: This project provided insights into using MongoDB with Mongoose, managing API routes, handling data relationships in NoSQL databases, and ensuring efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
